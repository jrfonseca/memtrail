About
=====

**memtrail** is a `LD_PRELOAD` based memory profiler and leak detector for Linux.

There are already many other open-source memory debugging/profiling tools for
Linux, several of which are listed on the [Links section below](#links), and
the most powerful arguably being Valgrind.  However, I needed a tool that could
quantify leaks and identify memory hogs, for long-running and CPU intensive
workloads, which simply run too slow under Valgrind's dynamic binary
instrumentation, hence this project.

![Build](https://github.com/jrfonseca/memtrail/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master)

Features
--------

* Very little runtime overhead

* Will immediately output maxmimum memory allocated and total leaked memory at
  the end of program execution.

* Text trees show callstacks for memory consuption or leaks

* Can produce graphs showing flow of memory consumption or leaks


Requirements
============

* Linux

* Python 3

* gzip

* binutils' addr2line

* [libunwind](https://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/)

  For best results (performance/stability) configure libunwind and build as

        ./configure --disable-cxx-exceptions --disable-debug-frame --disable-block-signals --disable-shared --enable-static --with-pic

  add set `UNWIND_SRC` environment variable to where the libunwind source is.

* [gprof2dot](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot) for graph output


Build
=====

    make


Usage
=====

Run the application you want to debug as

    memtrail record /path/to/application [args...]

and it will generate a record  `memtrail.data` in the current
directory.

View results with

    memtrail report --show-maximum

It will produce something like


    maximum: 8,960B

                -> 22.86% (2,048B, 1x): _start
    memtrail.maximum.json written

You can then use `gprof2dot.py` to obtain graphs highlighting memory leaks or
consumption:

    gprof2dot.py -f json memtrail.maximum.json | dot -Tpng -o memtrail.maximum.png

![Sample](sample.png)


It is also possible to trigger memtrail to take snapshots at specific points by
calling `memtrail_snapshot` from your code:

    #include "memtrail.h"
    
    ...
    
       memtrail_snapshot();
