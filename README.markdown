About
=====

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT READY FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION.

**memtrail** is a `LD_PRELOAD` based memory debugger/profiler for Linux.

There are already many other open-source memory debugging/profiling tools for
Linux, several of which are listed on Links section below, and the most
powerful arguably being Valgrind.  However, I needed a tool that could quantify
leaks and identify memory hogs, for long-running and CPU intensive workloads,
which simply run too slow under Valgrind's dynamic binary instrumentation,
hence this project.


Requirements
============

* Linux

* gzip

* [gprof2dot](http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot) for graph output


Build
=====

    make


Usage
=====

Run the application you want to debug as

    memtrail record /path/to/application [args...]

and it will generate a record  `memtrail.data` in the current
directory.

View results with

    memtrail report
